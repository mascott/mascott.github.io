I'm a software developer based out of Oklahoma, and I mostly work with Ruby and Rails.

I have three kids and an amazing wife. Seriously amazing. She's cool with  me building an 
Iron Man suit. Yeah, I know, I'm rediculous.

I'm also incredibly interested in 3d printing and am currently in the process of building
a second printer. I love talking about it, so if you're interested please ask. Just be
sure you have plenty of time available.
